							Hello! My name is Matthew Harris, a senior at Saint Francis University majoring in Cybersecurity. I have a passion for technology and innovation, always eager to learn and tackle new challenges. My expertise lies in cybersecurity. Throughtout my four years, I have taken classes that cover all aspects of cybersecurity.
							Classes include incident response, digital forensics, system administration, ethical hacking, etc. In addition to taking classes, I currently hold several leadership postions. As a resident assistant, I am constantly making an effort to 
							provide my residents the best on-campus living experience. I am also responsible for managing the JFK Center for Student Engagement tech team. My team is responsible for operating the audio and video for various programs that occur around campus.</p>
							<p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. My latest internship has taught me how to be an aware and detailed-oriented person. Awareness is everything.
							With cybersecurity constantly changing, it is important to update yourself with the latest news to keep from falling behind. I chose this field because I believe in safeguarding the digital world, ensuring that technology can be a force for good without fear of exploitation.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/IMG_7228.jpg" alt="Picture Failed to Load" /></span>
							When I'm not immersed in the world of technology or in the classroom, I enjoy hiking, biking, 3D-printing, and exploring new places. These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and inspire creativity in my work. Feel free to browse through my projects, resume, and contact me for any opportunities.</p>
